skycoin
=======

These are scripts for building a release package. They build the client and daemon binaries, 
and package a client distribution with assets for the chosen OS and arch.

Gox is used by default for compilation, if you want to use the standard go compiler use
USE_GOX=0 before running a build script.

If you just want to do a simple local build, from the root project directory do

$ go build cmd/skycoin/skycoin.go

and ignore this directory.
